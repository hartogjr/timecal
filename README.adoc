== Introduction

I set up this project for the game called
https://playrix.com/township/index.html[Townshipâ„¢], developed by
https://playrix.com/[Playrix]. In this game and probably many others, one
needs to initiate some process, which takes a certain amount of time, after
which you have to initiate another process.

This small application facilitates calculations needed to set up a timetable
for the game. It allows reading durations from the command line and
calculating when that duration will have passed, based on the current time or
another time you can specify.

This application is licensed under the BSD-3 license. See LICENSE for details.

== Manual

It reads times either as parameters, or run without parameters, it starts up
interactive mode in which you can enter more times after one another.

When entering times, one should always use 24-hour format. Leading zeroes can
be left out. The colon serves as the separator between hours and minutes. So
valid times include:

* `23:59` -> 1 minute to midnight
* `:` -> 00:00 -> midnight
* `0` -> 00:00 -> also midnight
* `3:` -> 03:00 -> 3 o'clock in the morning (am)
* `:45` -> 00:45 -> quarter to one in the night (am)
* `30` -> 00:30 -> half past twelve in the night (am)
* `17:` -> 17:00 -> five o'clock in the afternoon (pm)
* `6:7` -> 06:07 -> seven minutes past six in the morning (am)

The same formats are valid for durations. Internally, times and durations are
not handled separately. One is simply added to the other.

Note that this application takes day boundaries into account. This means that
any calculated sum will always be a valid time. For example, adding 3 hours
and 15 minutes (`3:15` or `03:15`) to quarter past 10 in the evening (`22:15`)
will result in `01:30`, not `25:30` or something like that. In short, hours
are always calculated modulo 24.

== History

I noticed I got a bit too addicted to the game, checking every process every
couple of minutes. This is of course the goal of the game, but I wasn't too
happy with me checking my phone every few minutes.

After a while, I started to make a text file with a schedule. I administered
which processes were running, planned and needed and made a time table when
which process would end or should be initiated. This way, I knew when the
earliest time was I could purposefully check the game again and in case I was
a bit later, which processes were done and which I could initiate. It bothered
me that I had to calculate all the times manually. This is why I created this
small command-line application.

During development, I thought it could be useful to others too and therefore
made a GitHub project out of it. This in turn made me want to be proud of my
code, resulting in a little over-engineering with unitchecks, command-line
interface, CMake and code coverage reporting.

== Plans

When I really have nothing to do any more, perhaps I will reverse engineer the
protocol used by Playrix and create an API. This would allow me to let my
computer do most of the planning and process initiation, probably taking the
fun out of playing, but replacing it with the satisfaction of having my town
improve by itself without my help, saving me a lot of time ;-)
